# Zgate Postman Collection

This folder is intended for storing Postman collections generated by or for the Zgate project.

- Place exported or generated Postman collection JSON files here for version control and sharing.
- You can use the `zgate-generate-postman-collection.js` script to generate a new collection from the output JSON payloads.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   npm run zgate-postman
   ```
2. Move or copy the generated `postman_collection.json` into this folder for organization.
